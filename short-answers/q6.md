# Question 6

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
Similar to `element.appendChild()`, `element.append()` attaches elements passed to the parent element we choose. However, a key advantage of `element.append()` over `element.appendChild()` is that it can take in multiple arguments, allowing us to append multiple elements at once rather than only one at a time as with `element.appendChild()`. In addition, `element.append()` can append text strings instead of needing to wrap them as text nodes first, as with `element.appendChild()`.

Below is a succinct comparison:
|                  | `element.append()` | `element.appendChild()` |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Arguments** | Multiple (can handle several nodes and text)          | One (only one node at a time)                       |
| **Type of Arguments** | Nodes and text strings                                 | Only nodes                                        |
| **Insertion** | Appends to whichever parent element defined, following the order of arguments from first to last     | Appends as the last child node of whichever parent defined, with no order applicable as it only appends one single node               |

As you can see, `element.append()` is more efficient and flexible, allowing for cleaner and less repetitive code, adhering to the DRY principle.
