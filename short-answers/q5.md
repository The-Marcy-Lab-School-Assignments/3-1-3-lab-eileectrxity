# Question 5

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
The danger behind inserting user-entered information directly into the DOM unescaped is that it leaves our application vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code directly into our web applications, disguised as just another unassuming user-generated input. When executed, these scripts can then potentially steal sensitive information, deface our site, or even redirect users to a fake site through a **Man-In-The-Middle (MitM)** phishing redirection attack.

To prevent this, it's important to **escape** and **sanitize** any user input before inserting it into the DOM:

- **Escaping** involves **neutralizing** user input by converting any special characters into their safe, literal equivalents through built-in functions or manual string replacement. This means that characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"` are converted to their HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`).
  - For example:
    ```js
    const escapeHTML = input => input
      .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
      .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
      .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
      .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
      .replace(/'/g, '&#039;');
      
    let userInput = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>";
    document.body.innerHTML = escapeHTML(userInput); //'&lt;script&gt;alert('Hacked!');&lt;/script&gt;'
    ```

- **Sanitizing** involves **cleaning and validating** user input, usually using a content-aware whitelist/blacklist or libraries like DOMPurify. This is similar to escaping but also ensures that inputs adhere to expected formats while removing any elements that could be malicious.
  - For example:
    ```js
    let userInput = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script><b>This is bold text.</b>";
    document.body.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)//'<b>This is bold text.</b>'
    ```

By escaping and sanitizing data, we can ensure that any user-provided input is rendered as valid plain text and not as executable JavaScript code or HTML markup. If we allow user input to be entered directly into the DOM *without* these precautions, we risk letting harmful scripts run, which can lead to serious security breaches and compromise our usersâ€™ data.
