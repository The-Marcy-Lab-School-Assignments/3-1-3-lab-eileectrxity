# Question 8

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
By using semantic elements, it means that we as developers are using named elements which give a hint into what their contents will contain. Meanwhile non-semantic elements are those that tell us nothing about their contents and are solely for grouping other related tags.

**Semantic elements include**: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` while **non-semantic elements include**: `<div>` and `<span>`.
