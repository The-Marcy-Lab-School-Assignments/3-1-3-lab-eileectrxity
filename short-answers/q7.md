# Question 7

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. **ES6 Modules Support**: Using `type="module"` allows us to use the more intuitive `import` and `export` statements. This allows us to decouple our code components into separate, manageable modules, keeping our code organized and reusable. Also, variables in modules are scoped to the module file, which prevents global namespace pollution and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.

2. **Automatic Deferred Loading**: Scripts with `type="module"` are automatically deferred, executing only after the entire DOM has been fully parsed. This is much simpler compared to the CommonJS syntax, where if we wanted the same functionality of multiple code modules, we would have had to define each script file in the correct order of use, along with their `defer` attributes.

Below you can find more details on CommonJS syntax vs ESModules syntax.
### CommonJS Syntax:
Requires manually defining script order and using `defer` attributes.

```js
/* other.js */
const test = 'I am a test';

module.exports = test //default export in CommonJS
module.exports = { test } //named export in CommonJS

/* index.js */
const test = require('./other.js'); //default import
const { test } = require('./other.js'); //named import

<head>
 <!-- order matters here -->
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
  <script defer src="./other.js"></script>
</head>
```

### ESModules Syntax:
Automatically defers script execution and supports modern modulation.

```js
/* other.js */
export const test = 'I am a test'; //named export

export default test; //default export

/* index.js */
import test from './other.js'; //default import
import { test } from './other.js'; //named import

<head>
 <!-- other meta tags -->
  <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
</head>

//note: scripts are best put at end of the HTML body to avoid any Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors
